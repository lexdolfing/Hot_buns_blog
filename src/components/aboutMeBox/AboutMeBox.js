            <p>Hi, I am Lex. For years I used to work as a professional baker, making everything from sourdough bread to croissants to pastries by hand. Recently I switched careers to become a software developer and moved to Paris. My baking passion has not stopped, and I want to share with my fellow baking nerds which recipeâ€™s I am using and what I am learning for them. So follow along in my journey to become an even better baker, and see the successes (and failures) that will follow.</p>
